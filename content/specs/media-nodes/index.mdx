Media nodes are processing and managing media streams (audio/video) within the network. 
They handle encoding, decoding, mixing, and routing of media streams. These nodes are fundamental 
to the network's functionality by supporting the core tasks required for media stream management. 

## Media Nodes in dRTC Network

The Media Node is the backbone of the Huddle01 network. 
When a user joins a conversation, the Orchestrator selects a 
media node from those available in the registry, 
based on resource usage and geographical proximity. 
Once selected, the media node allocates resources to 
handle the media traffic to and from the user. This infrastructure 
is for media processing and routing within the Huddle01 network, 
ensuring RTC connectivity between the users.

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle of the Media Node consists of four simple steps:

1. **Bootup**: The Media Node starts up and initializes the Media Engine with its capabilities.
2. **Register**: It advertises its capabilities to the Registry Network.
3. **Orchestration**: The Media Node awaits instructions from the Orchestrator Network.
4. **Quality of Service**: This module runs continuously in the background to ensure the Media Node delivers resources as advertised.

## API

The Media Node API allows external systems to interact with 
Media Nodes, facilitating the control and monitoring of media resources. 

Key functionalities of the API include:

1. **Resource Allocation**: Endpoints for allocating media resources based on 
current network demands and node capabilities.

2. **WebRTC Connection**: Methods to establish and manage WebRTC 
connections between clients and media nodes, ensuring seamless media streaming.

3. **Quality Monitoring**: Tools for tracking performance metrics, 
enabling continuous monitoring to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) 
standards are met.


## Media Engine

At its core, the Media Engine functions as a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU), responsible for managing WebRTC connections and routing media packets between them.

There are multiple open-source implementations of SFUs available:
