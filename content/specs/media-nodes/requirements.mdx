## Requirements for Media Node

### Network Requirements
- **Bandwidth**: Sufficient bandwidth to handle multiple simultaneous audio and video streams.
- **Ports**: Open ports for WebRTC connections.

Minimal requirements for network connectivity are:
```
- 1 Gbps Ethernet connection
- Open ports one per every worker
```

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor, preferably with high clock speed, to handle media encoding/decoding and routing.
- **Memory**: Adequate RAM to manage multiple concurrent streams (minimum 16GB recommended).
- **Storage**: Sufficient disk space for logging and temporary storage of media streams.
- **Network Interface**: High-performance network interface card (NIC) to manage high data throughput.

Minimal hardware requirements are:
```
- CPU: 4 core CPU
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- Storage: 10 GB SSD
```

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) for better performance and compatibility.
- **Dependencies**: Required libraries and tools such as Node.js, npm, and Docker.

Currently the following operation system and software versions are supported:
```
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Node.js ^18.x
```
