**Huddle01** is building a distributed people powered real-time communication network with blockchain mechanisms to enable real-time communication at scale
where users can monetize their resources by providing services to the network. This network is termed as `dRTC (distributed Real-Time Communication)`.
This network contains three types of systems - `Media Nodes`, `Orchestrator` and `Registry` which interact with each other based on a set of 
protocols and standards to fulfill the requirements of the network.


### `1.1 Media Nodes`
These are the Nodes which are responsible for processing and managing media streams (audio/video). They are at the core of the network.
Media nodes are responsible for encoding, decoding, mixing, and routing media streams in the network. They provide the most important
resources such as CPU, and bandwidth to the network.

### `1.2 Orchestrator`
Orchestrator is the system in the network which works as a central hub for managing different media nodes and their resources. Network exposes
a set of protocols and standards which can be used by the Orchestrator to use the resources of the media nodes. The Orchestrator is invisioned to
be totally custom built by different organizations based on their requirements.

### `1.3 Registry`
keeps track of all the media nodes which are available for use , monitors health and reports back on any abnormalities
