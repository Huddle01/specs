description: Introduction to the Huddle01 dRTC network
---

Huddle01 is building a distributed people powered real-time communication network with blockchain mechanisms to enable real-time communication at scale
where users can monetize their resources by providing services to the network. This network is termed as `dRTC (distributed Real-Time Communication)`.
This network contains three types of systems - Orchestrator, Media Nodes and Registry which interact with each other based on a set of 
protocols and standards to fulfill the requirements of the network.

## dRTC Network
The network is a collection of interacting systems based on a set of protocols and standards. The network is invisioned to be a fully decentralized
and distributed network where users can monetize their resources by providing different services to the network.

The network currently consists of three types of systems - Orchestrators, Media Nodes and Registry.

### 1.1 Orchestrator Nodes
Orchestrators select the best media servers and coordinates their interaction. It also maintains websocket connections 
with clients for WebRTC signaling and messaging.

### 1.2 Media Nodes
is an abstraction of WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) which processes and manages media streams, 
ensuring media communication between clients

### 1.3 Registry Nodes
keeps track of all the media nodes which are available for use , monitors health and reports back on any abnormalities
