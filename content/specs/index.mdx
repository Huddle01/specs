**Huddle01** is building a distributed people powered real-time communication network with blockchain mechanisms to enable real-time communication at scale
where users can monetize their resources by providing services to the network. This network is termed as `dRTC (distributed Real-Time Communication)`.
This network contains three types of systems - `Media Nodes`, `Orchestrator` and `Registry` which interact with each other based on a set of 
protocols and standards to fulfill the requirements of the network.


### `1.1 Media Nodes`
These are the Nodes which are responsible for processing and managing media streams (audio/video). They are at the core of the network.
Media nodes are responsible for encoding, decoding, mixing, and routing media streams in the network. They provide the most important
resources such as CPU, and bandwidth to the network.

### `1.2 Registry`
Its a system in the network which holds all the information about the media nodes such as QoS (Quality of Service), Latency, Bandwidth, CPU, etc.
It acts central registry for the network which can be used by the orchestrators or any other third party systems to get information about the media nodes
and any other information about the network. Registry right now is built on top of `Libp2p` and uses gossipsub to communicate with the network.

### `1.3 Orchestrator`
Orchestrator is the system in the network which works as a central hub for managing different media nodes and their resources. Network exposes
a set of protocols and standards which can be used by the Orchestrator to use the resources of the media nodes. Orchestrator holds the logic to manage different work being done by the media nodes and any custom logic which is required to be implemented
as per the requirements of different organizations.

We invision people building different orchestrators based on their requirements and many different open orchestrators being available for the network.
