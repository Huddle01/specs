These are the Nodes which are responsible for processing and managing media streams (audio/video). They are at the core of the network.
Media nodes are responsible for encoding, decoding, mixing, and routing media streams in the network. They provide the most important
resources such as CPU, and bandwidth to the network. In short, these nodes are what make the network work.

<Callout type="info">
The utility provided by the media nodes is to provide resources for a scalable and realiable way to process and route media stream in the network of dRTC.
</Callout>

In this section, we will discuss the architecture, lifecycle, and components of the Media Node. We will also discuss how the Media Node interacts with the Orchestrator and Registry Networks.

## Architecture
Every Media Node is composed of different components that work together to provide the interface required to process and route media streams.
The modules are divided as follows:
 1. **Media Engine**: This module runs a `Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)`, Which is responsible for managing different WebRTC connections and routing media packets between those connection.
 SFUs are the core building block for any media node, We will deep dive into the working of the media engine in the next section.
 2. **RPC Module**: Its responsible for handling the communication between the Media Node and any Orchestrator, Media Nodes in itself are designed to act 
 as a worker in the network and based on the instructions from the Orchestrator they take different actions.
 3. **Registry Module**: Its responsible for handling the communication between the Media Node and the Registry Network, Any Media Node if is ready to provide there resources
 must advertise itself to the Registry Network with the capabilities it can provide.
 4. **QoS Module**: Its responsible for handling the `Quality of Service` of any Media Node. Its kept in here to have checks and balances 
 on the resources provided by the Media Node and also to ensure that the Media Node is providing the resources as per the capabilities it has advertised to the network.

## Lifecycle
The lifecycle of the Media Node is very simple, It can be broken down into simple steps:
1. **Bootup**: Media Node boots up and starts the Media Engine with the capabilities it has.
2. **Registery**: Media Node advertises itself to the Registry Network with the capabilities it can provide.
3. **Orchestration**: Media Node waits for the instructions from the Orchestrator Network.
4. **Quality of Service**: This Module is always running in the background to ensure Media Nodes are providing the resources as per the capabilities they have advertised.

## Components

### Media Engine
Every dRTC Media Node uses several different protocols of communication to interact with different systems in the network such as WebRTC, RTP, RTCP, HTTP/2 etc.
