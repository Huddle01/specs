These are the Nodes which are responsible for processing and managing media streams (audio/video). They are at the core of the network.
Media nodes are responsible for encoding, decoding, mixing, and routing media streams in the network. They provide the most important
resources such as CPU, and bandwidth to the network. In short, these nodes are what make the network work.

<Callout type="info">
The utility provided by the media nodes is to provide resources for a scalable and realiable way to process and route media stream in the network of dRTC.
</Callout>

In this section, we will discuss the architecture, lifecycle, and components of the Media Node. We will also discuss how the Media Node interacts with the Orchestrator and Registry Networks.

## Architecture
Every Media Node is composed of different components that work together to provide the interface required to process and route media streams.
The modules are divided as follows:
 1. **Media Engine**: This is the core of the Media Node. It is responsible for encoding, decoding, mixing, and routing media streams.
 2. **RPC Module**: This module is responsible for handling the communication between the Media Node and the Orchestrator.
 3. **Registry Module**: This module is responsible for handling the communication between the Media Node and the Registry Network.
 4. **QoS Module**: This module is responsible for handling the Quality of Service (QoS) of the media streams.
