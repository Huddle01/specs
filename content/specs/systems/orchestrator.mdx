This is system in the dRTC network which is responsible for managing Media Nodes such that different Clients can utilise the resources provided by the Media Nodes.
Orchestrators are a key component of any large-scale distributed system. In the dRTC network the Orchestrators is the key component which allows the network
to be used at scale and actually be able to provide the `sub-second latency` and `high-quality video transmission` the network is designed for.

<Callout>
    Orchestration of Media Nodes is the key concept which is needed to be understood to understand the dRTC network.

The whole dRTC network is a big distributed system that consists of media nodes which are providing resource such as `CPU` and `Bandwidth` to the network.
These Media Nodes are running the dRTC network to provide sub-second latency and high-quality video transmission. But these Nodes needs to be manage on how to
utilise there resources. To better understand why we need an Orchestrator
