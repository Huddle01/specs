 - It does not make a sense to make the first sentence like this IMO. 
You can say: Orchestrator is the entry point of the dRTC network. It is responsible for ...

 - you don't need to overhype what the Orchestrator is. if it has more than two responsibilities 
 then you need to list it. IMO the main thing in the description of a system component 
 is first put it around what it is responsible for, then how the responsibility is tackled by the architecture, 
 and then implementation details. But I don't know the story line description style, albeit I think the introduction 
 at least should be similar. What is this component responsible for, when you need it and how it works.



<Callout>
    Orchestration of Media Nodes is the key concept which is needed to be understood to understand the dRTC network.
</Callout>

 - Again IDK about this style, in academia we never assumed what you need to know or not, 
 we always claimed in present form and if you needed to look forward then it's a reference.
 RFC specification also do not use the terminology of "what is needed to be understood" just 
 defining section by section and describe as dry as possible.

You really make a dewscription like how would you present it to a friend. 
Again, maybe in this "story line" specification it is the way, it is just sounds and looks alien to me in a specification (albeit I admit I lack of the experience to claim that this is not the way).
