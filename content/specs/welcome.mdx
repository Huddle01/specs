Huddle01 is a decentralized real-time communication (dRTC) platform that enables secure, 
peer-to-peer video conferencing over the internet. Built on blockchain technology, 
it leverages a network of nodes to facilitate direct media traffic between users, 
ensuring high performance and low latency. 
Huddle01 integrates Web3 features like token-gating, NFTs as avatars. 
Economic incentives are built into the platform to maintain reliable and continuous service, 
enhancing user privacy and security without the need for centralized servers.
